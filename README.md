# Web Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of my final year during my **Bachelor of Technology** at the **College of Engineering, Pune (COEP)**, under the guidance of the late *Prof. Jagannath V. Aghav*.  
The system formed the foundation for our research paper later published in Springer’s *Data, Engineering and Applications – IDEA 2021* proceedings.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design a **machine learning–based intrusion detection system** capable of identifying and classifying web-based attacks in network traffic.  
The model distinguishes between normal and malicious messages, as well as categorizes detected threats into multiple web attack types.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Weka  
- **Dataset:** [UNSW-NB15](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset) — over 10,000 records of labeled network traffic  
- **Algorithms Evaluated:** Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Rule-Based Classifiers

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Dataset Preprocessing** – Cleaned and normalized the UNSW-NB15 dataset to remove redundancy and prepare for model training.  
2. **Model Training** – Used multiple ML models (Tree, Bayes, and Rule-based) to analyze classification accuracy and computational efficiency.  
3. **Algorithm Comparison** – Results compared using **Weka** to identify the most efficient model for attack detection.  
4. **Evaluation Metrics** – Assessed models on precision, recall, F1-score, and overall detection rate.
